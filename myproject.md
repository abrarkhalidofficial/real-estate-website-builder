1. Overview

1.1 Purpose

This platform enables users to instantly create professional real estate websites by selecting templates, uploading content, and optionally using AI to generate text and visuals. It’s designed for agents, agencies, and developers who want to quickly establish an online presence without coding or design skills.

1.2 Core Vision (with Suggestions)

The goal isn’t just to make a “website builder,” but a real estate experience generator — where each website feels like a living, breathing digital showroom.

Suggestions:
• Add a guided onboarding assistant (chat-style UI) that helps users describe their business, tone, and goals — then personalizes the template and AI output accordingly.
• Introduce a “Smart Theme” system: AI automatically adapts color palettes and typography based on uploaded logo or brand color.
• Allow users to save and reuse templates for multiple properties, turning it into a scalable system for agencies managing multiple sites.
